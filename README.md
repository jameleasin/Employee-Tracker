<h3>Starting the app locally</h3>

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:
<br />

<code>npm install</code>
<br />
This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.
<br />

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:
<br />

<code>node server</code>
Your app should now be running on http://localhost:3000. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
